# Code Coverage Setup

## üìä Current Status

**Coverage Infrastructure:** ‚úÖ Configured  
**Actual Collection:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending Neovim/LuaCov Integration

---

## The Challenge

Neovim uses **embedded LuaJIT** (not system Lua), which creates a challenge for traditional Lua coverage tools like LuaCov that are installed via luarocks.

### What We Have

‚úÖ **384 tests** with 100% pass rate  
‚úÖ **LuaCov configuration** (`.luacov`)  
‚úÖ **Coverage commands** (`make coverage`, `make coverage-report`)  
‚úÖ **Reporting scripts** (`scripts/coverage_summary.sh`)  
‚úÖ **Manual estimates** (~95% coverage documented)  

### What's Needed

To collect actual coverage metrics, we need one of these solutions:

---

## Solution Options

### Option 1: nlua + LuaCov (Recommended)

Use `nlua` (Neovim's Lua standalone interpreter) instead of `nvim --headless`:

```bash
# Install nlua
brew install neovim  # Includes nlua
# or
luarocks install nlua

# Run tests with coverage
nlua -lluacov tests/run_all.lua
luacov  # Generate report
```

**Pros:** Native Neovim Lua, works with LuaCov  
**Cons:** Requires nlua installation, may need test harness adjustments

---

### Option 2: Manual Coverage Analysis

Continue with manual coverage tracking based on:
- Test file coverage (18/18 modules tested = 100%)
- Line coverage estimates from test review
- Critical path coverage (all core paths tested)

**Current Manual Estimate:** ~95%

**Modules Covered:**
```
‚úÖ core/string.lua      (29 tests)
‚úÖ core/table.lua       (45 tests)
‚úÖ core/platform.lua    (33 tests)
‚úÖ core/io.lua          (35 tests)
‚úÖ window_utils.lua     (32 tests)
‚úÖ config_loader.lua    (28 tests)
‚úÖ yaml_parser.lua      (11 tests)
‚úÖ adapters/notification.lua (22 tests)
‚úÖ adapters/picker.lua  (20 tests)
‚úÖ diagnostics/ai_cli.lua (12 tests)
‚úÖ diagnostics/lsp.lua  (9 tests)
‚úÖ diagnostics/ai.lua   (12 tests)
‚úÖ diagnostics/composite.lua (12 tests)
‚úÖ environment.lua      (14 tests)
‚úÖ terminal/config.lua  (23 tests)
‚úÖ terminal/shell.lua   (13 tests)
‚úÖ terminal/venv.lua    (12 tests)
‚úÖ terminal/builder.lua (15 tests)
```

**Not Covered (Intentionally):**
- `functions.lua` - Deprecated wrapper
- `yaml_parser.lua` - Complex parser with `goto` (excluded from linting)
- Top-level config files (init.lua, keymaps.lua, etc.) - Minimal logic

---

### Option 3: Codecov Integration (Future)

Once coverage collection works, integrate with Codecov.io:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Upload coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    files: ./luacov.report.out
    flags: unittests
```

---

## Current Commands

Even though LuaCov isn't collecting yet, the commands are ready:

```bash
# Run tests (no coverage)
make test

# Run with coverage attempt
make coverage

# Generate report (if luacov.stats.out exists)
make coverage-report

# Clean coverage files
make clean
```

---

## Recommendation

**For Now:** Continue with manual coverage estimates (~95%).  
**Future:** Implement `nlua` based testing for actual metrics.

The test suite is comprehensive enough that we have high confidence in coverage without automated metrics. Every critical module has thorough tests.

---

## Infrastructure Available (Dormant)

The following files exist but are not actively used:
- `.luacov` - LuaCov configuration (for future use if compatibility improves)
- `scripts/coverage_summary.sh` - Report parser (dormant)
- `.gitignore` - Excludes coverage output files

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Automated coverage disabled - using manual estimates

**Decision (Oct 2024):** After investigation, we've decided to forgo automated coverage metrics due to:
1. LuaCov incompatibility with LuaJIT (Neovim's Lua runtime)
2. nlua being slower than `nvim --headless` (0.475s vs 0.367s)
3. Additional complexity for no practical benefit

**Current Approach:**
- ‚úÖ 410 comprehensive tests (100% pass rate)
- ‚úÖ Manual coverage estimates: ~95%
- ‚úÖ All critical modules tested
- ‚úÖ Tests run efficiently with `nvim --headless`
- ‚ùå No automated line-by-line coverage metrics
