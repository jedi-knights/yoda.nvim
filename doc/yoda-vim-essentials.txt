THE BIG PICTURE                              *yoda-vim-essentials-big-picture*

Vim Modes~
  • Normal Mode - Navigate and execute commands (default)
  • Insert Mode - Type text like a normal editor
  • Visual Mode - Select text  
  • Command Mode - Execute commands (: prompts)

Mode Switching~
    <Esc>                      Return to Normal mode (from any mode)
    i                          Insert before cursor
    a                          Insert after cursor
    v                          Visual selection
    :                          Command mode

Key Concept~
Vim is modal - different modes for different tasks. Start in Normal mode,
switch to Insert to type, return to Normal to navigate and execute commands.
