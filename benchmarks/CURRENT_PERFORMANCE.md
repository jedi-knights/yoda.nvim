## 🚧 Known Issues

### 1. Startup Log Shows Hang
- **File**: `startup.log`
- **Issue**: Shows massive delay at the end: `1997944.909  1997925.729: --- NVIM STARTED ---`
- **Impact**: Indicates Neovim may be waiting on something after startup
- **Action Required**: Investigate what's blocking after init

### 2. Benchmark Script Timeout
- **File**: `scripts/benchmark_performance.sh`
- **Issue**: Times out when trying to run benchmarks
- **Likely Cause**: Neovim hanging on certain operations
- **Action Required**: Debug why nvim hangs in headless mode

### 3. Missing Baseline Metrics
- **Issue**: No pre-optimization baseline measurements
- **Impact**: Can't calculate exact improvement percentages
- **Action Required**: Document estimated improvements based on git history
