## Installation

> **Note:** This assumes a working Neovim (0.9+) installation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jedi-knights/yoda ~/.config/nvim
nvim
```

Upon first launch, `lazy.nvim` will bootstrap the plugin setup automatically.

---

## Usage

- `<leader>e` - Toggle file explorer (`nvim-tree.lua`)
- `<leader>ff` - Find files using Telescope
- `<leader>fg` - Live grep search in files
- `<leader>qq` - Quit Neovim

(Full keymap cheatsheet coming soon!)

---

## Customization

Yoda is modular and designed for easy customization:

- Change colorschemes in `core/colorscheme.lua`
- Add or remove plugins under `plugins/spec/`
- Adjust options in `core/options.lua`
- Customize LSP servers in `lsp/servers/`

Detailed walkthroughs for customization will be available in the [docs](docs/).
